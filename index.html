            <div class="stext">This site was created as part of an assignment for the Odin Project. The task was to copy
                from a reference image. This project has taught me a great lesson in web design.
                When in doubt, just spam flex boxes. Flex boxes are OP. Anyway, this site has to be filled up with some 
                sort of content so I guess I'll just fill it up with random images.

            <div>City Girl is one of my favorite musicians. All of her albums are good, but 
                Chroma Velocity and Goddess of the Hollow are absolute bangers.

            <div>Vickisigh makes all the artwork for City Girl. She is crazy talented and makes the most
                fire art I've ever seen. Definitely check her out.
